# weather
    An app to get the current weather a 5 day forecast

# Code
    HTML, JS, CSS and 3 party APIs used to create the code.

# How it works
    The use inputs a city name, the API converts the name into a location, and provides the weather data.  The code provides the information from the return into readable forms.  Previous searches are listed in case another search of recent locations checked is needed.
